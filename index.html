                My adorable cat Kimi is one and a half years old. She is a mix of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Fold" target="_blank">Scottish Fold</a> and 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Shorthair" target="_blank">British Shorthair</a>. 
                She joined our family in May 2023 when she was just two months old. Our family named her Kimi because 
                my brother liked the name Kiki while my mom wanted to name her Mia, so we combined the two names to 
                form Kimi. She has a shy personality, but she can be quite playful sometimes, especially in the 
                evenings. She is docile and never causes any troubles. We all love her very much!
